# Ticket-to-Talent-The-H-1B-Lottery-Insight

This project will analyze the essential factors that affect H-1B visa approvals, emphasizing the demographics of applicants such as gender, age, nationality, and education as well as the characteristics of employers, including industry sector and geographic distribution. We seek to uncover patterns in successful applications by examining trends from the last three years. These trends will show us the changing demand for international talent, giving important insights and recommendations to future applicants on making informed decisions about potential employers and regions with higher H-1B approval rates. Comparing this with the general context of the US job market, this project aims to identify sectors with both high H-1B approval rates and favorable employment conditions. We seek to provide a deeper understanding of where international talent is in demand and what types of roles may offer competitive wages, improving our recommendations for H-1B applicants.
